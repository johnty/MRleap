Leap External for Max/MSP

Made by Martin Ritter martin@martin-ritter.com

Windows VS project files by Johnty Wang johntywang@gmail.com

Unzip into MAX_SDK/examples/oneMoreDir/, and it should compile assuming your LeapSDK root folder is at the same level as the MAX_SDK directory.

Tested with:
- OSX 10.9, universal binary, running MAX 6.
- Windows 7 and 8.1 64bit, Visual Studio 2012, running MAX 6 32-bit. Currently requires VS2012 installed to work in MaxMSP. Also may crash on exit on some systems. ;)
